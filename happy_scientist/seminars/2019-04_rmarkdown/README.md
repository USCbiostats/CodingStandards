# Happy Scientist Seminar: How R Markdown helped me thrive in scientific research ðŸ“š and advance my career development ðŸ‘”
## About the talk

**Abstract** Description: R has made it easy for us to wrangle data and build models. With the power of the R Markdown family packages, your analysis can be easily turned into high-quality reproducible documents including reports, presentations, posters, webpages, dashboards, scientific articles, websites and more. We will look at a couple of real-life case studies in which R Markdown helps a graduate student navigate scientific research and career development.

Marie-Anne Paulze Lavoisier (1758 â€“ 1836) was a French chemist and noble. She was the wife of Antonie Lavoisier and has helped him to accurately and precisely sketching diagrams of experimental designs, translating documents, and publishing the book, which ultimately helped his research to be widely understood and used by the scientific community.
