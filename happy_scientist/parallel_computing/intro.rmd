# Intro

## HPC in R

Out of the box parallel computing:

*   foreach

*   iterators

*   parallel


Not so out of the box parallel computing:

*   Rcpp + OpenMP

*   RcppParallel (uses intel's TBB)


Others to mention:

*   Hadoop + MapReduce

*   Sparkr

*   bigmem


## When to 'parallel computing'


*   Talk about vectorization (efficient code)? Garrett's example

*   Is is possible to implement in a paralleel fashion?

*   ...

# Examples

We can write the examples in different files...

## Example 1: parallel

## Example 2: parallel

## Example 3: foreach + iterators

## Example 4: foreach + iterators 

## Example 5: Rcpp + OpenMP

## Example 6: Rcpp + OpenMP
