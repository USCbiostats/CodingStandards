# New Core C/D Assessment Project Template

This document provides a general framework for assessing the software and computing needs of a particular project.

The first step consists on answering the following questions:

- [ ] In a paragraph, describe what is the project about.
- [ ] List the project's specific goals (e.g. make the method available for public use, create a webservice, present this analysis)
- [ ] Think about what are your computing/software needs, and list them.

Once a general overview of the project has been defined, the next step consists on analyzing the following:

## Infrastructure for Reproducible Research

- [ ] Create a git repository for the paper (suggest using the [USCbiostats github](https://github.com/USCbiostats)).
- [ ] Organize your files in a neat way
- [ ] Put all the files required to reproduce the results, or at least placeholders (hopefully `readme.md` files for each folder). You can find an example of a readme file [here]()
- [ ] List all the software requirements including names and versions in the readme.md file.
- [ ] Set up the project using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
