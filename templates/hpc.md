- [ ] In a paragraph, describe what is the project about.
- [ ] List the project's specific goals (e.g. make the method available for public use, create a webservice, present this analysis)
- [ ] Think about what are your computing/software needs, and list them.

Once a general overview of the project has been defined, the next step consists on analyzing the following:

## HPC assessment and consultation

- [ ] Is my code neat (vectorized)?
- [ ] Think about what parts are parelelizable or not.
- [ ] Look for out-of-the-box tools on CRAN and BioC.
